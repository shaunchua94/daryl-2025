    I love seeing your heart for people and the way you care so deeply for those around us. I’m 
    so thankful for your soft heart toward God and how you keep choosing to draw near to Him—it 
    inspires me and makes me love you even more.

    I still remember a few years ago when we were praying together for open doors for your studies.
    And now, seeing where God has brought us… it’s such a beautiful reminder of His goodness and 
    perfect timing. I’m so grateful to be walking this journey with you—through every prayer, every answered promise, every challenge, and every joy.

    Here’s to many more adventures, milestones, and dreams fulfilled together! 🐻">

    You have been a really mature and steady presence in the lg. I always say this i think but 
    i really gain alot of insights through your sharings. Not sure if it's cos of your profession 
    ahahaha but I think you are a deeply reflective person who is anchored in Christ! It's been 
    encouraging to hear how you try your best to walk with God, through the different areas of 
    your life. I hope and pray that you will continue to stick close to Him as you venture into a new chapter of your 
    life!
    
    So exciting to see you pursue your professional interest even further, though it means you'll 
    be miles apart from us for 3 years :( I really pray that you will use that time to not just 
    grow professionally but personally as well! even as a couple. It's not your first time being 
    abroad so I'm sure you know life can go in any direction, but I hope that this time it'll be 
    different as you have a church community, and reaffirmed your faith in Christ. 

    Praying for you to remain rooted in Christ regardless of what happens or how busy you may get! 
    Also praying for this period for you to recalibrate and recharge yourself, HOPEFULLY the pace 
    of life there would be slower, since you dont have to work haha. 

    Just want to say that we are still here for you, so do ping us or me if you need anything, or
    even just a prayer. Waiting for you and baoru to come back! Stay safe and take care of
    yourself!">

  <div class="card" data-name="Huiru" data-message="Hello Daryl!

    Happy happy birthday to you!!! Whenever I think about you, I’d always be reminded of that convo 
    we had about how we might not be the perfect Christians, seeking God as fervently as we hoped for. 
    I’d then always be very encouraged how your heart is still tender for God, & also be reminded that 
    God’s mercies are new everyday, & we can fail at things but we are struggling with victory already 
    won on the Cross for us! 

    This period is probably such an exciting moment for you, & I’m so so excited to see the greater 
    heights or depths God is going to take you to! I wanna encourage you with this:


    For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor
    the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be
    able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
    —Romans 8:38-39

    God’s love will not be less because we’re not as on fire for Him today. His love is based on 
    His faithfulness & not ours. Take heart my friend! 

    Agape,
    Anna (Huiru)">

    aww, the last birthday to celebrate in sg before you leave for uk :')
    thankyouu for your hospitality towards the lg, and for serving in ways that you can.
    appreciate your sharings during lg, and how sometimes you struggle at work or even in your personal 
    life to listen and hear God's ways for you - but each time, you still place Him first above all :') 

    excited for what's in store for baoru & you as yall prepare to go overseas - the lg may be very far
    apart physically, and with the difference in time zone, but we're still one community and we'll be 
    here should yall require any support :') 

    praying that God will be upon you as you prepare for your studies as well, and that He has greater 
    plans for you; and that you'll be able to find a community to settle in while overseas as well!">

    Big year ahead — new age, new season, and a whole new adventure overseas. Wishing you peace, 
    wisdom, and joy as you take on PhD life! Praying over you and BaoRu to find your rhythm, 
    community, and little moments of grace along the way. You’ve got this 🙌

    Hope this season of preparation has been kind to you! 

    It’s been a blessing know you through lg! Thanks for serving the lg by always saying yes to 
    opening your place and booking the facilities for us. Especially the time during boys lg 
    where you booked the tenpanyaki place, bought, prepared the ingredients yourself and even 
    cooked for us! ❤️

    Enjoy your bday and can’t wait to catch up with you when you’ve settled down overseas!">

  <div class="card" data-name="Shaun" data-message="Hey Daryl,

    You've come quite a long way, still recall the early days when you were visting Hope. 

    Glad that you found a community to settle down with, and I trust we have added on to each other. You have definitely supported the LG with the counselling side of you, I think it is comforting to hear your comments that uplift people. 

    Although you are making a move, just want to share that I hope we can continue to journey together. Don't know how it will play out, but I guess we'll figure it out one step at a time.

    Trust in Him always!

    Yours in Christ,

    Hope your preparation for the big move is all good! 

    I just want to take this moment to thank you for your heartfelt sharing, especially after the
    conference, when you spoke about keeping Christ at the center of a relationship and always
    looking to Him for strength and that “extra” love for our partners. I pray that you and Baoru 
    will hold on to this truth, uplifting and supporting each other as you embark on this new 
    milestone together.

    Also, thank you for booking the BBQ pit for our LG—I really really had fun! 

    All the best and may your year be filled with many blessings!

    continue to empower and use you guys in ways that you never imagined. Praying for blessings
